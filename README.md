This folder contains proof-of-work demonstrating my ability to deliver the primary offer outcome.

The strongest proof for my offer is a:
☑ **Sample**

This proof exists to show that I can define a launch-ready digital product for early-stage SaaS founders.

## **SAMPLE — Product Definition Pack (1-Page)**

### Product Name (Working)

LaunchScope

### Target User

Early-stage SaaS founder (pre-seed to seed) with an idea but no shipped product or low initial traction.

### Core Problem

Founders overbuild or stall because they do not know what the *minimum sellable product* is or how to price it.

### Outcome Definition

A product that can be built and launched in ≤ 7 days and sold to first users.

### Core Value Proposition

“Define exactly what to build, what to sell, and what to charge—before writing unnecessary code.”

### Must-Have Features (3–5 only)

1. Problem-to-feature mapping (one feature = one pain)
2. Single primary user flow
3. Clear success action (what the user pays for)
4. Lightweight onboarding or delivery mechanism

### Explicit Non-Goals

* No advanced automation
* No multi-role permissions
* No secondary features not tied to first revenue

### Pricing Hypothesis

$49–$99 one-time or $10–$19/month based on urgency and frequency of use.

### 7-Day Launch Path

* Day 1–2: Build core feature only
* Day 3: Connect payment or access gate
* Day 4–5: Prepare landing page + copy
* Day 6–7: Release to first users

### Launch Readiness Check (Binary)

* Problem clearly stated: YES
* Buyer defined: YES
* Feature list ≤ 5: YES
* Price decided: YES

## Context

**What problem this addresses**
Early-stage SaaS founders struggle with unclear product scope and packaging, leading to overbuilding, delayed launches, and products that do not generate revenue.

**What was done**
A one-page Product Definition Pack was created to clearly define the target user, core problem, minimum sellable features, pricing hypothesis, and a 7-day launch path.

**What outcome it demonstrates**
The artifact demonstrates a decision-ready, launch-ready product definition that enables a founder to ship and sell a product within 7 days without further clarification.
